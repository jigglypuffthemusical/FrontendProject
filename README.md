## Description
```
I created a website for my future bakery. I wanted to feature my portfolio work of some of my desserts and people I worked with over the years. I wanted the website to be visually appealing so I put many pictures. I created easy navigation for the customer using bootstrap. I created a funtion using javascript to create a slideshow and I used CSS to design the layout, padding, font, and background colors of the page. I created a form which is simple and easy for the customer to fill out and alerts them if a field is empty and needs to be filled out before submitting. 

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
The classes I created are:

1. class name .footer
This class creates a sticky footer which doesn't vertically collapse with any above sections when window is resized or scrolled. I used a padding of 0 to make sure it stretches the full width of the screen, I also added a background color and made sure the copyright text is centered at all time. 

2. class name .container
This class creates a visually appealing division to to the main content of the page. It is seperated with a padding from the rest of the content as well as given a silver background color to seperate it from the picture on top and footer on bottom. The 5% padding gives it a nice spacing from the rest of the material on the page no matter the size of the viewport. 

3. class name .about
I created this class to make the about section stand out with a different font-color and font-style. I wanted this section to stand out even with many picture on the page. I thought that can be best done with a pop of color on the page. 

```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created was ContinueSlideshow:

1. function name ContinueSlideshow() )
What function ContinueSlideshow() does is it creates a loop of pictures that runs on 3 second interval and moves on to the next image. If it is at the last image it will move back up to the first image and continue the slideshow without ever ending. I didn't want the images to be too big as it would lose resolution as I didn't take it with a high quality camera at that time so I kept it relatively small in size.
